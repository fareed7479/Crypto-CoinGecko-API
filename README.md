# 📈 Real-Time Crypto Price Tracker

A responsive web application built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, designed to simulate real-time cryptocurrency price tracking with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Crypto Price Tracker** displays the current prices of major cryptocurrencies, showcasing dynamic updates and a streamlined interface. It is built as part of an assignment to demonstrate front-end development skills and efficient state management using Redux.

### ✅ Features

- 💹 **Simulated Real-Time Price Updates**
- 🖥️ **Responsive Design** — Works across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- 📊 **Visual Feedback** — Percentage change is color-coded (green for gain, red for loss)
- ⚛️ **State Management** — Implemented with Redux Toolkit
- 🧪 **Clean and Maintainable Code Structure**

> **Note**: Although initially planned to use the CoinGecko API, the current version simulates live updates using Redux-managed state without API or WebSocket integration.
