# 📈 Real-Time Crypto Price Tracker

A responsive web application built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, designed to simulate real-time cryptocurrency price tracking with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Crypto Price Tracker** displays current prices of major cryptocurrencies with dynamic, simulated real-time updates. Developed as part of an assignment submission, the project showcases efficient state management, responsive design, and clean UI components.

> 🔔 **Note**: While initially intended to use the CoinGecko API, this version uses Redux-based simulated data to demonstrate real-time functionality without external APIs or WebSocket integration.
